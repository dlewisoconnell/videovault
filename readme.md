My final project for Code Louisville's Web Dev 1 class is called the Virtual Video Vault. I incorporate html, css and javascript to create a responsive layout with mobile and desktop media queries on the main pages and full headers, footers and body sections. The layouts are designed using flexbox. On the "Vault" page I used a javascript array to display images of various vhs tapes organized by genre. The images on the vault are aligned to look good on mobile first, with an expanded view for desktop. Every page created to be easily accessible. 

Required features include:
- Responsive CSS menu
- PageSpeed Insight Performance: 100, 98 on the "vault"
- Menus in lists, titles in headers, alt tags for images to increase accessibility, changed font size to em from px, changed syntax to better be found easier by screen readers as suggested by accessibility check
- Transform CSS animation on main page and individual content pages
- Javascript array on "Vault" page
