            In a quickly changing world where media is consumed at an break-neck pace, streaming has become king. For a monthly fee our access to movies has never been greater, but some of us remember a different time. A time when when you could hold a tangible video tape in your hand. A time when you could get lost in the aisles of a rental store, gazing into the artwork of seemingly endless tapes. 
            <p><img src="intro-image1.jpg" class="intro-image1">Depending on who you're talking to, a VHS tape could either be a relic of the past or a time capsule that can take you back decades. The fuzz and grit of the tape presenting a familiarity of the cracks and pops of an old record of your favorite song. The warble and the static acting as a log of each pass through the VCR. 
            <br><br>And while the rest of the world moves onto new technologies, donating their tape collections to make shelf space, these treasures wind up in second hand stores everywhere. The tapes you'll find here at the Virtual Video Vault have been saved from the purgetory of bins and boxes in thrift stores across the country, and brought to a loving home.
            <p>The Virtual Video Vault has been curated to appreciate and recreate the video rental experience of the 80s and 90s. Please enjoy.
